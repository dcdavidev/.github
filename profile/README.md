<p align="center"><strong>The hive that orchestrates the flow</p>

hxve is a next-generation API Gateway, a hive for orchestration where systems, applications, and services converge into harmony.
It doesn’t just route traffic — it conducts the flow. From unifying disparate data sources to managing authentication, security, and documentation, hxve becomes the central bridge in modern, distributed, and scalable architectures.

Minimal by design and modular at its core, hxve enables you to:

- Connect SQL, NoSQL, and external services through a single interface.
- Expose standardized endpoints (REST, gRPC, GraphQL, tRPC, OpenAPI) without duplicating logic.
- Apply security policies, rate limiting, and monitoring in one place.
- Streamline development with an extensible ecosystem and CLI tooling.

In a world of ever-growing complexity, hxve emerges as the neural node that turns distributed chaos into orchestrated order
